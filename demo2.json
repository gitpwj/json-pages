            "rendered": "<p>QL- Custom Technology Limited is a professional company that specializes in Custom made Over molding cable assembly and wire harnesses. Overmolded cables are full assemblies that combine the wire and connector into one single, seamless piece. To do this, the cable assembly is placed inside a mold. Next, molten plastic material is injected into the mold cavity. QL-Custom operates in a modern facility that houses warehousing, engineering, production, and important support activities at hand to satisfy all our customers. Superior product line The range of products in the plastic molding category includes GPS position track devices, vacuum cleaner parts, outdoor\/indoor parts, speaker frames, molded connectors, and sockets, as well as other plastic products. Our cable products have grown in popularity to make us a world-class supplier of important items including custom molded cable, automotive wire harness, solar cables, and other wire solutions customized for individual customers. QL-Custom will work with clients throughout the entire process to produce the designs you desire to your specifications. The quality department will analyze all products using advanced testing apparatus before we quickly deliver the parts to your preferred destination. We certainly have the ability and capacity to meet virtually any needs you might have with regards to plastic molding and cable harness, relying on our time-tested quality workforce to assure products that will never let you down.<\/p>\n<p>Custom Molded Cables<\/p>\n<p>From extreme environmental stresses to the strains of abrasion and high-repetition movement, molded cable assemblies must be built to last. Without rigorous attention to the demands found in the field, a single cable assembly can lead to downtime, lost productivity, and decreased ROI. That&#8217;s why Cypress Industries ensures that each custom cable assembly is designed, manufactured, and tested according to the strictest specifications.<\/p>\n<p>We review all of the demands imposed on each cable assembly and bring a wealth of options to the table. After choosing the right materials (we work with PVC, rubber, Santoprene, ABS, Polycarbonate (PC), Macromelt, and many others) we identify the best production processes. Each stage of pre molding, potting and overmolding is reviewed. We provide the right mix of waterproofing and abrasion resistance, meeting IP67 and IP68 standards if necessary. Soldering and crimp joints are examined, and remolding, overmolding, or both can be incorporated to secure the connections and provide strain relief, durability, and long, useful life. We can design custom potting fixtures machined in specific shapes, adding coatings to the potting fixtures to ensure a good release and a clean finish. We also provide potting of junction boxes to provide weatherproof seals.<\/p>\n<p>Benefits of overmolding<br \/>\nTo do this, the cable assembly is placed inside a mold. The first material (the substrate) is covered by the other materials in this process. Our skilled engineering and sales reception capabilities on industrial cable assemblies can respond quickly to customer inquiries, like Military connectors, Aviation Connectors these industrial cables. We assist in developing different cabling quality requirements in accordance with IPC620 industry standards. Fully work with your engineers, we can develop a product from an idea to a job as well as to meet the mass production of the customer.<\/p>\n<p>Overmolded cable assembly internal components fortify protective qualities and help cable assemblies survive in even the most rugged environments. By overmolding your cable assemblies, you will:<br \/>\n\u2022 Increase the flexibility at the cable exit, where most of the movement between a cable and connector takes place<br \/>\n\u2022 Provide resistance to abrasion and shock or impact<br \/>\n\u2022 Make cable assemblies tamper-proof by encapsulating components beneath a sealed resin<br \/>\n\u2022 Provide 360-degree strain relief and increased pull strength<br \/>\n\u2022 Create a water-resistant or water-tight seal that qualifies cable assemblies for IP certification<br \/>\n\u2022 Improve the overall quality, appearance, and feel of cable assemblies, replacing the need for expensive metal backshells<br \/>\n\u2022 Simplify installation by creating a one-piece assembly with keys that act as visual indicators to assist in the mating of each pair<br \/>\n\u2022 Reduce human error<\/p>\n<p>Cable Assembly Overmoldering Process<\/p>\n<p>The over-molding of a cable assembly is accomplished by forcing material into a mold cavity under a great deal of pressure. For cable assemblies, the most popular materials used for an overmold are thermoplastic or thermoset materials. The injection molding machine, also known as a press, consists of a storage area for the mold resin. Sometimes it can be called a hopper. Delivery for the material is usually an injection ram or a screw-type plunger enclosed inside a metal tube also known as a barrel. Heating elements are installed into the barrel of the machine causing the mold resin to be heated to a molten state.<\/p>\n<p>The process begins with the resin specified for the mold being fed into the heated barrel of the molding machine at the hopper end. It is then mixed with any desired colorants and transits the length of the barrel to the actual mold where the resin and colorant mixture is forced into the mold cavities. Once inside the mold cavity, the material will cool taking on any features designed into the mold itself including logos, trade names, or part numbers.<\/p>\n<p>Molded strain relief<\/p>\n<p>Strain relief is a standard fixture for electrical cables that functions as a feature for relieving the stress from the cable connections themselves to prevent them from breaking. It is located in the base of the connector where the connector meets the cable and usually comes pre-molded as part of the connector itself. It is the part of the connector that looks like a sleeve over the cable and is often segmented to allow some limited bending without problems.<\/p>\n<p>On other cables, especially those that are manufactured separate from their connectors, strain relief often comes in the form of a separate device that is installed over the connector and the cable joint. In the case of network cables, the strain relief is called the &#8220;boot,&#8221; which is fitted over the connector after attaching the cable and the RJ-45 connector. In other connectors, the strain relief can be in the form of metallic connectors and grips, some of them made of metal that is crimped over the cable to provide tensile strength.<\/p>\n<p>We understand the challenges and trends cutting across the electrical design processes across the world and our engineers are always ready to walk with you in this process. Our valuable integration resource saves time and costs for global customers thanks to an effective engineering team that is skilled and meticulous, always dedicated to delivering products that meet the highest standards as stipulated by industry standards. You are assured of a quick production process that is executed to precision.<\/p>\n",

Wire harnesses range in complexity from a few individual wires going point to point to hundreds of individual wires, multiconductor cables, and welded wires all forming a complex wire harness used to transmit power and all types of data.<\/p>\n<p>Wire harness designs are highly customizable, as harnesses are typically designed to suit specific applications. They may need to be concealed behind walls, fit within electrical boxes, or conform to other space constraints. Precise measurements of the environment, power demand, and lengths must be taken during design to prevent costly mistakes and ensure the proper safety and functionality of the final product.<\/p>\n<p>The harness must fit neatly in its intended space. For example, harnesses in vehicles are very compact to ensure they can fit within the small electrical boxes contained within cars. Outer protective casing size must be taken into consideration.<\/p>\n<p>Wire harnesses often require intricate construction design with mechanical fastening, over-moulded connectors, grommets, strain reliefs, and ultrasonic welds. Types of terminals and how they fit the wire radius are critical decisions during the design.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">FAQ<\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Q1: What is a wire harness, and how is it different from a wiring harness or cable assembly?<\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>A wire harness, also known as a wiring harness or cable assembly, is a collection of wires or cables bound together with protective coverings.

            "rendered": "<p>Cable assemblies are a group of wires covered by more intensive exterior products. It is a group of cables that have been cut to a specific length and bundled together in a precise orientation to make assembly and installation easier. The cable assembly supplier can bind it together using tape or cable ties, or a sleeve can be placed over top to keep the cables together. The cable assembly companies created specifically for the application are a valuable solution for OEMs across a range of different sectors such as Industrial, Medical, Automotive, Marine and Security. Cable assembly used for a variety of businesses from all industries that require the use of electronic equipment have needs for cable assemblies. Because cable assemblies are designed to hold and organize many different electrical wires safely, they can be used in a variety of indoor and outdoor settings. Cable assemblies protect technicians and contractors from the potential hazards of an electrical current. They also protect external materials that could be harmed by electricity or materials that could conduct electricity, thereby causing harm to bystanders. Wire harnesses allow electricians to easily navigate electrical systems. They keep the wiring in a highly organized configuration, which helps technicians to avoid a time-consuming analysis of how the systemic components fit together. Cable assemblies also serve as a protection for the wires and cables housed within their sheaths. They guard the wiring against wear and tear, harsh environmental conditions, and other incidental damage.<\/p>\n<p>To perform higher standards the benefits that cable assemblies can provide to manufacturers and customers alike.<\/p>\n<p>\u25cf Safety<br \/>\n\u25cf Service life<br \/>\n\u25cf Space<br \/>\n\u25cf Customizable<\/p>\n<p>The cable assembly companies provide safe consolidation of potentially dangerous electrical wiring. They allow electricians to keep the wiring well-organized and simultaneously protect the wiring from outside elements. Wire harnesses keep cables from becoming tangled or bent and also protect them from exposure to harmful environmental factors. This improves the ultimate life of the cables. The Wire harnesses keep cables from becoming tangled or bent and also protect them from exposure to harmful environmental factors. This improves the ultimate life of the cables.<br \/>\nCable assemblies help manufacturers to optimize the space inside of electronics to provide additional room for other parts and components. Even if additional space isn\u2019t required, wire harnesses still decrease clutter caused by individual loose cables. And Customized cable assemblies often support specific functionality in products.<\/p>\n<p>The major cable assembly uses are transmitting information signals or power. Cable assembly is normally designed for environmental factors. The major services included are Cutting and preparing wires. Our fully automatic Komax 255 and wire processing machines cut, strip, tin dip and crimp single or multi-core wires. Crimped cable assemblies thus we hold a vast range of automatic connector and crimp tooling for all major manufacturers including TE Connectivity, Molex, Amphenol, JST, ITT Cannon, DEUTSCH and Hirose. And Cable looms and harness assembly. Applications range from simple panel wiring to complex interconnect harnesses for a wide range of industries including the Industrial, Automotive, Medical and Marine sectors.<\/p>\n<p>The type of cable assemblies includes a variety of options in cable assemblies manufacturing such as multi-conductor, coaxial\/RF, wire and cable harnesses, complex military, flat ribbon, custom electro-mechanical, and more. Although there are similarities, there are variations as well. Among harness, assemblies are different types, one being basic. Depending on the exact product, this might include only three discreet components whereas a classic type harness could be designed with several more, as well as various other components that are passive or possibly active. Usually, there are dozens of wires and in some instances, hundreds of unique terminations and components. The most urgent and much-needed five cable assemblies are; Military Grade Cable Assemblies, There are several strict requirements for cable assemblies marked as military-grade, and a separate set of requirements for the connectors on your cables and the wires used in the assembly. Additionally, the use of the cable assembly is taken into account; the requirements for cable assemblies that will be used in underwater environments are t from those used on planes. Military-grade cable assemblies are often required for field communication links, airborne systems, remote weapons control, marine systems, military ground equipment, and inter-shelter communications. RF\/EMI Cable Assemblies,<br \/>\nRFI is radio frequency interference that occurs on the radio frequency spectrum. EMI references electromagnetic interference. \u201cBoth man-made and natural sources generate changing electrical currents and voltages that can cause EMI: ignition systems, a cellular network of mobile phones, lightning, solar flares, and auroras Northern\/Southern Lights.\u201d There are applications where you may want to leverage these signals and times when you may not want them. You\u2019ll want to work with your cable assembly creator to figure out what is best for you. Moulded Cable Assemblies,<br \/>\nHDMI cables are typically moulded cable assemblies. Below you can find an image of an HDMI cable underneath the moulded shell. Moulded assemblies are typically used in applications where a more durable and finished appearance is desired so if those are your requirements, a moulded cable assembly may be the way to go. Assembled Coaxial Round, A Coaxial cable \u201cis a type of electrical cable that has an inner conductor surrounded by a tubular insulating layer, surrounded by a tubular conducting shield. Many coaxial cables also have an insulating outer sheath or jacket. Flat Ribbon Cable Assemblies, Flat Ribbon cables look cool. Rather than the wires being bundled together within a sheath, the wires are nicely organized in a flat ribbon.

The temperature range of this type of PVC wires and cables is as follows.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed Laying: -40\u00baC bis +70\u00ba C<\/li>\n<li>Flexible Application: +5\u00baC bis +70 \u00b0C<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Cold Resistant PVC<\/h3>\n<p>Cold-resistant PVC is known for its extreme cold resistance even at sub-zero temperatures.\u00a0This type of cold-resistant PVC wires and cables exhibits some excellent\u00a0mechanical strength and flexibility.<\/p>\n<p>Nevertheless, it also shows good performance when exposed to various or extreme weather influences. The temperature range of this type of PVC wires and cables is as follows.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed Laying: -40\u00baC bis +70\u00ba C<\/li>\n<li>Flexible Application: -20\u00baC bis +70 \u00b0C<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3>Heat Resistant PVC<\/h3>\n<p>This type of PVC wires and cables can resist extreme temperatures up to +105\u00b0C. The insulation and sheath materials used within this type possess excellent electrical and mechanical values to suit higher temperatures.<\/p>\n<p>However, not many cables or wires of this type can bear a temperature beyond the maximum and if exposed beyond maximum temperature, it can reduce the usable life of the wire or the cable. The temperature range of this type of PVC wires and cables is as follows.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed Laying: -40\u00baC bis +90\u00ba C<\/li>\n<li>Flexible Application: +5 \u00baC bis +90 \u00b0C<\/li>\n<li>Short time use: \u2013 bis+150 \u00b0C<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3>Oil Resistant PVC<\/h3>\n<p>In this type of PVC cable and wires, the mixtures used are oil resistant. The mixture is mostly used as a sheath material in cables but can also be used in wires as insulation. The temperature range of this type of PVC wires and cables is as follows.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed Laying: &#8211; 40\u00baC bis +70\u00ba C<\/li>\n<li>Flexible Application: +5 \u00baC bis +70 \u00b0C<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>PVC can also be classified as inflammable because of its chemical composition. However certain elements may be released through a PVC wire or cable during a fire which is dangerous to humans, nature, buildings, and machines.<\/p>\n<p>Now that you know the types of PVC wires and cables available, let\u2019s take a look at their uses.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h2>PVC Wire and Cable Uses<\/h2>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]PVC wires and cables are commonly used for home appliances, wiring of circuits, instruments, house wiring, mining operations, power supply solutions, submarines, ship wiring, etc.\u00a0they\u2019re even used in high temperature-sensitive environments like kitchen and related appliances.<\/p>\n<p>The uses of PVC wires and cables come only from their properties. So it\u2019s important to understand how certain properties of PVC wires and cables support different uses of PVC wires and cables. Below are five main properties of PVC wires and cables and how they contribute to certain uses.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><b><\/b><strong><b>High versatility-<\/b><\/strong>One of the main uses of PVC wires and cables is its high versatility. The versatility has given PVC wires and cables extreme flexibility to be modified according to different requirements.<br \/>\nThey\u2019re even recyclable and easy to modify using plasticizers and lubricants. This versatility has increased the use of PVC wires and cables in complicated industries.<\/li>\n<li><b><\/b><strong><b>Extreme durability-<\/b><\/strong>PVC wires and cables are highly durable. This feature is similar to other copper wire types that are sturdy and robustly built and yet very supple.<br \/>\nThis has increased the usability of PVC wires and cables and their overall longevity. The durability also comes with another great use of resistance. \u00a0PVC wires and cables are resistant to corrosion, abrasion, chemical, and water most of the time. They\u2019re also rustproof and offer shock absorption capabilities, which increases\u00a0the durability even more.<\/li>\n<li><b><\/b><strong><b>Safety-<\/b><\/strong>Another major use of PVC wires and cables is its safety. As we all know many wires and cables can become unsafe due to various reasons. Especially the weak resistance to any unexpected environmental conditions is always a concern in wires and cables.<br \/>\nPVC cables and wires, however, have greater resistance increasing its suitability in sensitive environments such as kitchen and related appliances.<br \/>\nThis is because the material PVC in common is a highly dependable type of material which is odorless and non-toxic (suitable for food-related environments such as kitchens).<br \/>\nAlso, the heat, water, and chemical resistance have increased the usability of PVC wires and cables in kitchens and other similar environments even more.<\/li>\n<li><b><\/b><strong><b>Customizable-<\/b><\/strong>The versatility and flexibility of PVC have made PVC wires and cables highly customizable. They can easily be molded into any shape or other preference. In fact, if you need PVC wires or products in bulk quantities you can easily customize them into any shape or size your business needs.<br \/>\nPVC wires or cables are also cost-effective when you order in bulk quantities. This customizable feature has made PVC wires and cables easy to be used in household or convenient goods on a much large scale.<br \/>\nEven the manufacturing industries largely use PVC wires and cables because of this customizability. \u00a0Commercial products such as electric motors, panel boards, control cables, and power transformers mainly use PVC wires or cables.<\/li>\n<li><b><\/b><strong><b>Simple To Use<\/b><\/strong>\u2013 Another main use that comes with PVC wires and cables is the simplicity and easy-to-use features. This simplicity is again because of the highly versatile property that PVC cables and wires have, making it easy to use for any complicated need.<br \/>\nThe simplicity of use is also one of the reasons why PVC wires and cables are mainly used in home appliances. Easy to use also means PVC wires and cables can withstand rough usage. This is why PVC wires or cables do not damage or need to be replaced as often &#8211; because of their high strength.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Let\u2019s take a look then finally at the\u00a0process involved in making PVC wires and cables.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h2>PVC Cable and Wire Manufacturing Process<\/h2>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<p>The process involved in making PVC wires and cables is\u00a0fairly\u00a0simple and cost-effective\u00a0because it\u2019s been refined over a long period of time.\u00a0This is why PVC wires and cables are cheaper compared to other cables and wires.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The material PVC used in PVC wires and cables goes through a process called polymerization.\u00a0This is where PVC is easily softened by heating making it highly versatile and giving all the flexible properties which PVC wires and cables are well known for.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This process also makes PVC wires and cables lightweight and reduces \u2018dielectric losses\u2019\u00a0and internal stress in electrical applications &#8211; making it easily usable within any appliances or any industry. However, the strength, longevity, and durability of cables and wires remain unchanged by this process.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>To Conclude<\/h2>\n<p>We hope this has been useful in understanding how PVC cable and wires are made, used, the types, along with the Pros and Cons of their use.

Thermocouple wire is used to control instrumentation and for building the sensing point in a thermocouple and is made out of two dissimilar metals.<\/b><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>To start off on this topic, let\u2019s begin with one common question many have when it comes to wires, which is the length.[\/vc_column_text][vc_single_image image=&#8221;3559&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221;][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">Overmolded Thermocouple cable<\/span><\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h2>Usable Lengths of Thermocouple Wire<\/h2>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]There are many factors that impact the usable length of a thermocouple. The two main factors that affect the usable length of thermocouple wire are total loop resistance and electrical noise.<\/p>\n<p>Thermocouple wires are made of different conductor materials. Because of this, the total loop resistance varies from based on the type as well as the wire diameter and length. However, the main goal for a usable length of thermocouple wire is to keep the loop resistance under 100 ohms.<\/p>\n<p>With the other factor, the longer the wire, the higher the possibilities of it getting influenced by electrical\/radiated noise. This long length of the wire will then affect the performance of the wire. As such the usable length of thermocouple wire is recommended not to run or exceed a minimum of 10 feet.<\/p>\n<p>And in case the wire is extended it is recommended to use a shield to reduce the noise interference to an acceptable level. For this purpose, a metal over brad or twisted shielded wire can be used. At the same time avoid running wires closer to sensitive areas like motors and power wires.<\/p>\n<p>All in all, the recommended goal for a usable wire length is to keep the wire reduced to less than 100 feet with 20 AWG or thicker wire in an area free of electromagnetic interference. Now with the recommended lengths defined, let\u2019s get into the types of thermocouple wires available and how they differ.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h2>Types of Thermocouple Wire<\/h2>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]The are many different types of thermocouples that are available to suit different measuring applications such as industrial, scientific, food temperature, medical research, etc. It is, in fact, the different types of thermocouple wires that enable thermocouples to suit different applications.<\/p>\n<p>So to understand this better the thermocouple wire types are listed below with the positive electrode first, followed by the negative electrode.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h3>1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Positive Electrode Thermocouple Wire Types<\/h3>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><b>Type K<\/b><\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Made out of Chromel (Nickel-Chromium Alloy) \/ Alumel (Nickel-Aluminium Alloy), type K thermocouple wires are the most commonly used for general purposes.

But still, it is one of the last components that is addressed or given importance to. In fact, an over or under designed cable assembly will have a tremendous negative consequence in the performance of the electronic system.<\/p>\n<p><strong><b>What Is A Cable Assembly?<\/b><\/strong>\u00a0Cable assembly is a group of wires or cables that are organized and integrated into a single unit. Cable assembly is primarily used to transmit power, signals, and information to the designated application and to provide cables protection. Cable assembly also makes an application easy to use, repair and maintain.<\/p>\n<p>A cable assembly is also known as wiring looms or cable harness. You will be able to find cable assemblies of various sizes, colors, lengths, and sizes depending on the application. Anyway to give you a more detailed view on this topic I have an interesting flow of subheadings below.[\/vc_column_text][vc_single_image image=&#8221;3537&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221;][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Cable assembly &amp; Harness<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h2>How It Works<\/h2>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]As we might know electronic devices and applications deal with many cables that are often overwhelming to maintain. Think of an instance where the cables are tangled and the pain to untangle them. This can even cause disruptions in the flow of signals and power. So what a cable assembly does is bring the different cable components in an application or device to a single unit in a neat and well-organized manner. This will prevent the cables from getting all over the place and make it easier to use and maintain.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, rough usage of cables and other unpredictable weather conditions can easily damage cables and disrupt their functioning. So under a cable assembly, all the cables are neatly bundled in an extremely durable sheet of material of exterior covering. This will thereby act as a protective layer for all the cables and its overall functionality. Likewise, a cable assembly also protects the cables from external environment uncertainties, easy wear, and tear and other rough usages.<\/p>\n<p>Now that we know how it works, \u00a0let\u2019s see how it\u2019s made.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h2>How Its Made<\/h2>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]Cable assemblies are manufactured using outer sheaths that protect the cables from the external environment. Especially it protects the cables from ultraviolet radiations, moisture, oil, heat, fire, and cold. At the same times, the outer sheaths make the cables resistant to any plethora condition. In fact, what is great about cable assemblies is that it can withstand any major unpredictable environmental conditions.<\/p>\n<p>Most of the cable assemblies are made out of recyclable and environmentally friendly materials. One of the beneficial things about how a cable assembly is made is that they have an extensive range of connectors and terminals. This extensive range of terminals and connectors can be used for controlling input, output, data and electrical current in an effective and efficient manner.<\/p>\n<p>While this is the usual way how a cable assembly is made, they can also be custom-made. Custom made cable assembly address specific challenges and specification of devices and environments such as fire, moist, dust, friction, chemical and temperature exposure, flexibility and so on. The customization can also extend to desired shapes, sizes and colors.<\/p>\n<p>So if the cable assembly option that your device may require is complex, you will need to specify it to an expert or any other specialized organizations and get it customized.<\/p>\n<p>Now if you\u2019re already shopping for cable assemblies and find it challenging to get hold of one, let me help you. I\u2019ve compiled five of the most common cable assembly types. One of these could be the one you&#8217;re looking for to suit your device or application. Or, you could just <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ql-custom.com\/contact-us.html\"><b><u>Email us <\/u><\/b><\/a>and we can help with your requirements.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h2>5 Common Cable Assembly Types<\/h2>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]Before I begin, it\u2019s worth noting that\u00a0these are just a few common cable assembly types which are\u00a0also used or searched for frequently. However, there are many other types\u00a0of cable assemblies which can range from simple to complex designs.[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h3>Military Grade Cable Assemblies<\/h3>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]As the name implies, these are cable assemblies focused on aerospace, tactical and marine applications. Military grade cable assemblies need to be met with tough requirements and specifications. There\u2019s even a separate set of requirements that need to be met with the connectors and wires that will be used in military graded cable assemblies. This is because the purpose of military graded cable assembly is to be suitable for rough and unpredictable environments.<\/p>\n<p>These type of cable assemblies are used for fields of communication links, military ground equipment, inter-shelter communications, and remote weapon control, marine and airborne systems. So as you can see, these cable assemblies needed for underwater environments are totally different from military graded cable assemblies.[\/vc_column_text][vc_single_image image=&#8221;3539&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221;][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Millitary cablings<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h3>RFI\/EMI Shielded Cable Assemblies<\/h3>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]We\u2019re living in an extremely electrically noisy world, and believe it or not, each of your cables is also adding to that noise. Yes, cables also get affected by EMI (electromagnetic interference) or RFI (radio frequency interference). These interferences cause several disruptions within the electrical system of your device.<\/p>\n<p>For example, you may experience loss of data, poor signal quality, degraded performance or even completely ceasing the functions of your device. So the best way to eliminate this is to opt for an RF\/EMI shielding for your cable assemblies.<\/p>\n<p>There are two main types of shielding options available such as foil and braided shielding. Foil shielding attempts to cover the entire conductor of a cable assembly. Braided shielding, on the other hand, weaves copper into a mesh and surrounds the entire conductor. Likewise, braided shielding gives more protection from the interferences &#8211; but are more expensive.

Identifying these two are extremely important to conduct and execute an effective wire harness design.<\/p>\n<p>Geometrical focus tries to identify the specific space in which the wire harness design needs to be fixed. This will help identify if the harness design needs to cater to a larger or smaller network of electrical wiring.<\/p>\n<p>The second focus is on identifying the potential electrical shortages that could happen with the design. For this purpose, the design will focus on the specific electrical guidelines that have to be met along with the design. This will ensure the wires are protected both from internal and external damages from electrical issues.<\/p>\n<p>However, as an all cases, wire harness design will focus mainly on the reliability, function, and efficiency of the product, rather than the art.

A wiring harness diagram is different from a schematic diagram. It makes use of abstract symbols to represent the components of a connection.[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-3521\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ql-custom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Automotive-wire-harness-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ql-custom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Automotive-wire-harness-1.jpg 900w, https:\/\/www.ql-custom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Automotive-wire-harness-1-800x600.jpg 800w, https:\/\/www.ql-custom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Automotive-wire-harness-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.ql-custom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Automotive-wire-harness-1-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/>[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Automotive Wiring Harness Diagrams<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]An ideal wiring harness diagram will have symbolized components, optimum positioning, splice positions, and wire colours.\u00a0This will help differentiate the different points that need to go into the wiring process. The appearance of the diagram is a typical representation of how the wire bundling will ultimately look like.<\/p>\n<p>In fact from the appearance of the diagram, you can decide how complicated or how pure your custom wire harness will be.<\/p>\n<p>If you find it difficult to create a wiring diagram for your application, you can <a href=\"mail:sales@QL-Custom.com\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong><u><b>consult an expert<\/b><\/u><\/strong><\/span><\/a>\u00a0for this purpose. Also, remember the success of an electric wire harness design will only depend on the wiring harness diagram. So it\u2019s important to ensure the wiring harness diagram is accurately designed before execution.<\/p>\n<p>Once the diagram is designed you can then start focusing on the process required to execute it with the above-mentioned things ready. So now let\u2019s see the basic process for executing a wire harness diagram.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h2>Basic Wiring Harness Design Process<\/h2>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]The following are the basic three steps required to design a wiring harness with the things mentioned above.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h3>Step One<\/h3>\n<p>With the diagram in hand, the required wires are cut as per the diagram. This is usually done using a special machine to be accurate on the numbers. However, you can also use a wire cutter for this purpose. Then after the wires are stripped exposing the core of the wire using a wire stripper. The core of the wire will be usually metallic in nature and is fitted into the connector housings, also known as crimping.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h3>Step Two<\/h3>\n<p>The next thing to be done is clamping of the wires as specified by the diagram. You can make use of a crimping plier\/ratcheting crimpers for this purpose. This is usually done on special workbench or pin board. After clamping the wire, the collections can be fastened with cable ties, zip ties or tapes and fitted into necessary cable components as per the diagram. The assembly of the design process is now complete and this can be directly fitted into the device of use.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h3>Step Three<\/h3>\n<p>The final step is to test the functionality and efficiency of the wiring harness. This can be done with the help of a test board. Each of the primary wires can be tested individually or as a collection. If the test doesn\u2019t give the expected output, there will be a need to realign the wire design or structuring until the expected output is given.<\/p>\n<p>These days,\u00a0all these steps are conducted in an automated manner. So, without some expertise, attempting to do it manually yourself means you might well make mistakes. So to avoid them, keep reading and find out what could go wrong.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h2>Mistakes to Avoid in Electrical Wiring Harness Design<\/h2>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]Sometimes the wire harness design might not work in the way you expect it to. This is mainly because the wire harnessing diagram is not appropriately designed. Apart from this, the following are a few other possible mistakes of electric wire harness design.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cutting the wires too short which then fails proper connections onthe entire cable harness.<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Failing to identify the right signal, workflows and other functional or analytical requirements of the intended connection.<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Not implementing the planned design as it is, or bringing amendments or adjustments to the design while executing.<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Failing to standardize the design according to accepted electrical or manufacturing standards. Although this may not cause a defect in the harness it may frequently cause errors leading to financial costs.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h2>Finding the Right Wire Harness Assembly Partner for Your Project<\/h2>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]It\u2019s important to remember that this provides a very basic overview and understanding of how an electric wire and cable harness design is laid out and executed.<\/p>\n<p>Some applications may require complex designs and approaches.

In fact, it\u2019s now becoming one of the comfortable cable options for users.<\/p>\n<p>What Is Molded Cable? <span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><b>Molded cables are created by injecting heated molten material into a mold cavity. The mold mechanically attaches the connectors to the cables making it a single part. This gives the cable the ability to withstand vibration, shock, and flexibility along with good exposure to a harsher environment.<\/b><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Molded cables have become extremely important among many users. But many users rarely notice they use a molded cable. This applies to everyday\u00a0objects; you perhaps didn\u2019t know your\u00a0phone charger had a molded cable. So let\u2019s\u00a0give you a clear guide on these types of\u00a0cable.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h1>How\u00a0a Cable\u00a0Is\u00a0Molded?<\/h1>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]The molding process takes a great deal of pressure in forcing material into a mold cavity. It all starts by installing molding materials into the heated barrel of the molding machine. When heated, the material melts and turns into a resin. Any desired colorants can be mixed at this point. The resin mixed with the colorant is then forced into the mold cavities. After cooling, it will then take the appearance of the mold including any\u00a0trade names, logos and so on.<\/p>\n<p>Pretty useful\u00a0right?

However, they all more or less narrow down to the following types of molded cables.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Standardized Molded Cables<\/h3>\n<p>These are the standard molded cables that are designed to meet the essential uses of a molded cable. These include rugged performances, watertight compatibility, superior strength, and other compulsory technical specifications.<\/p>\n<p>Most of the standard molded cables can be found in the form of medical cables, RF cables, USB cables, and HDMI cables. These types are the most basic form of molded cables and are used\u00a0just about everywhere. They\u2019re also the most low cost\u00a0molded cables you can get purchase. In fact, there\u2019s a high chance\u00a0you\u2019d be coming across this type of molded cables daily. Maybe even in your own household applications.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Molded Cables For Harsh\u00a0Environments<\/h3>\n<p>This is a recent trend taking over the types of molded cables available. This is where a molded cable is given the additional reliability and durability to withstand extreme weather conditions. It also includes the added benefit of risk-free termination under urgent situations. This type of cable is significantly designed to cater to industries or organizations that are prone to a harsher environment.<\/p>\n<p>However, they may be comparatively slightly more expensive as it requires more complexity in designing and greater material usage. We can help you with\u00a0choosing the right cable for you so it\u2019s always a good idea to get in touch.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h1>Custom Molded Cable<\/h1>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]As the word indicates,\u00a0these types of cable are customized to better suit your application needs and requirements. Custom molded cables are one of the highly demanded cables in the market. This has now created an endless range of customizable features in molded cables.<\/p>\n<p>Customization, by its very nature,\u00a0can come at a higher price. Custom molded cables can be the most\u00a0expensive out of all the types of molded cables. And of course, depending on the complexity involved within the customization, the price can get even higher. so again, it\u2019s worth coming to talk to us about your requirements first<\/p>\n<p>Customizing cables is a perfect solution if you\u2019re looking for alternative ways to make and find a cable to suit your applications. So let\u2019s give you a round-up on the most common customizable features in molded cables.

This customizable feature in molded cables is\u00a0commonly used in video security, military, and recreational applications.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/3&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;3468&#8243;][vc_column_text]PG16 Cable gland[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/3&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;3470&#8243;][vc_column_text]Cable Joints PG threads[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/3&#8243;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h2>Cable Stops<\/h2>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]Cables are often\u00a0treated with greater force than\u00a0they were designed for when\u00a0in use. This excessive force can sometimes be transferred causing connections to break. So to avoid this, molded cables can now be customized with cable stops.<\/p>\n<p>Cable stops transfer all the force inserted to a cable to an anchor point. The force that is then anchored will make sure no connections occur or ensures connections are not compromised.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h2>Conductor Sizes<\/h2>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]Even conductor sizes are customizable in molded cables.

High performance customized molded cables offer adaptability to any environment. Issues such as water tightness or sterilization compatibility are better handled by this type of molded cable.<\/p>\n<p>But as you might be able to guess, with high performance comes a higher price. So this type of customized molded cables can be expensive comparatively. In this instance, come and speak to us so we can properly advise what specification you need.<\/p>\n<p>So let\u2019s have a look at some of the uses for\u00a0Molded Cables.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h1>Functions and Uses\u00a0of Molded Cables<\/h1>\n<p>All the uses of molded cables are narrowed down to two main requirements, these are,[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h2>1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Protection<\/h2>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]One of the core use of molded cables is its ability to serve as a protector for the different components in a cable. In recent times, many connections between wires and connectors are set by soldering.<\/p>\n<p>Soldering\u00a0is where two metals are joined by melting. The purpose of soldering is to create a permanent connection between two electronic components.<\/p>\n<p>So it\u2019s extremely important that nothing gets between the soldered connections.\u00a0Especially water, metal pieces or any other sensitive environmental conditions can easily disrupt the connection or cause damages to the wire or the connector. As such with the use of molded cables, the protection necessary for cables is inbuilt. In fact, molded cables assure a long life span for soldered elements of a cable.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h2>2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Resistance &amp; Insulated<\/h2>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]Molded cable has the ability to withstand changing environmental conditions. This is yet another significant use of molded cables. We can all accept that not all cables can perform at its best under given environmental conditions. In contrast, molded cables can withstand more extreme weather, frequent strain, constant flexibility and exposure to dust or debris. This gives users more reliability with\u00a0molded cables over other cables.<\/p>\n<p>With that being said, let\u2019s\u00a0provide a\u00a0breakdown to the above uses for even greater\u00a0understanding.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Molded cables increase flexibility at the cable exit. As the cable exit is where most of the movement takes place, this flexibility gives molded cables a longer usage.<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0As mentioned, molded cables are highly resistant to different environmental conditions, abrasion and are equally shockproof. Again giving molded cables more life span and greaterreliability.<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0Molded cables provide 360-degree strain relief with an increased pull strength. This will make sure the cable is not easily damaged by rough or intense usage of the cables.<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0The most obvious use of molded cables is the high customization options it provides.As we\u2019ve already covered the customization options available for molded cables, this is definitely a major use of molded cables.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This is because it gives users convenience in creating cables that best suits their applications and\u00a0requirements.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, it\u2019s the protection and resistance that makes molded cables the best use for most applications, even for home appliances and accessories. Molded cables are used in headphones, stereos, cell phone chargers, power cords, USB cables, laptop chargers, and many other everyday devices.<\/p>\n<p>Just walk around your house or office and you\u2019ll know your daily life depends on and is largely run on molded cables.<\/p>\n<p>So, let\u2019s cover\u00a0the materials used in molded cables?[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h1>Materials Used In Molded Cables<\/h1>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]As described previously,\u00a0there are customizable materials in a molded cable. But then nowadays photopolymers are commonly used for simple injection molds in molded cables.<\/p>\n<p>This has become possible through 3D printing. The photopolymer material allows low-temperature resin for a small number of molding cycles. However, a smaller number of molding cycles can cause the mold to wear out easily. That, unfortunately, means molded cables that use molds with lesser molding cycles can have a shorter life span and can wear more easily.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, if hardened steels are used in molds it guarantees high life expectancy.<\/p>\n<p>This is because hardened steel is given\u00a0a higher number of molding cycles, enabling\u00a0them to become relatively stronger. Hardened steel molds in molded cables are used typically in mass production environments. However, on the negative side, these molded cables can be expensive.<\/p>\n<p>Aluminum can also be used for molds in molded cables. However, aluminum is a softer material and can only go through a smaller number of molding cycles. Again this means that the molded cable can only expect a shorter life span. But in terms of price, they have a lower cost. This is because aluminum has a greater malleability giving a lower tool fabrication cost.<\/p>\n<p>Along with this remember that the materials used for molds are usually decided based on the material that will be used for the molding. For example, if thermoplastic is used for the resin, the mold material can something be like aluminum and steel (hardened or stainless).<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, a liquid injection type material like silicone used for molding will call for tooling that is hardened steel.<\/p>\n<p>Recently 3D printed materials are used to test the mold and to produce test cables. This use of 3D printed molds is quicker, easier and cost-effective for testing. Also, it\u2019s best to mention most of the molds nowadays are produced with the support of CNC (Computer Numeric Control). Some molded cables use electrical discharge machining processes.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h1>Conclusion<\/h1>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]Molded cables in simple terms are cables that are molded to give better protection, resistance, and an overall longer cable life. These cables are taken\u00a0through a detailed and careful molding process that gives the cable the right texture, appearance and overall performance expected from a molded cable. Molded cables are made using a range of materials such as photopolymers, hardened steels, and aluminum. The materials and its ability to go through higher or smaller molding cycles will decide the life span of the cables. And of course, the price of cables depends on the materials it uses and the number of molding cycles.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Currently, there are many types of molded cable such as standard molded cables, molded cables for more harsh environments, customized molded cables and high performing molded cables. Out of these types, the custom molded cables are special. They have the ability to be customized to better suit your applications. There are many features in molded cables that can be customized. The most common customizable features range from sizes, colors, materials, fillers, insulation, and shields.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Despite the types, all the molded cables serve for two primary functions,\u00a0protection and resistance. Flexibility, adaptability, customization to better suit applications and adaptability to harsher environments are a few other supporting uses of molded cables.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We hope this has been useful for you in understanding more about Molded Cables.

It silently goes about its business and you probably don\u2019t give it a second thought.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Here at QL-Custom we have many years of experience with low pressure molding, so we thought we\u2019d share some of the main points about this process with you in this article.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Here\u2019s a quick take away answer for you, then we\u2019ll dive deeper into the process and benefits of low pressure molding, not only for applications but for the environment too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">So What is Low Pressure Molding? <strong><b>Low Pressure Molding is a technique for protecting and encapsulating components prone to damage, moisture, or other external influences. Typical in applications such as wiring and printed circuit boards. Using materials known as hot-melts, polymers are used to seal around components using specialist machinery.<\/b><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><b>\u00a0<\/b><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Dimer acid based Polyamide materials often referred to as \u2018hot-melts\u2019, are thermoplastics that, when heated to specific temperatures become pliable and malleable for use around precious connectors and connections.<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][vc_video link=&#8221;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=S9WjHDqZ2_E&#8221; el_width=&#8221;60&#8243; align=&#8221;center&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\">Why it&#8217;s called Low Pressure Molding<\/span><\/strong>[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Low pressure molding, (or LPM) in particular, is as the name suggests, the use of lower pressure processes and techniques used where components may suffer from the normal pressure or extreme heat otherwise used in more industry standard pressure molding applications.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">To reiterate, there are two main reasons an application may require the use of Low Pressure Molding.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Malleability<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">One major factor is the need for the applied thermoplastics to be more viscose. Viscosity allows the injected material to be applied to much small or complex spaces and cavities. To apply at low pressure often a manual gear pump process is used, this provides sufficient pressure to drive the viscose material between components.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">This helps to prevent fragile components from becoming dislodged or broken and provides greater protection and stability to otherwise unprotected electronics.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The viscosity is measured in what is known as <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Poise_(unit)\"><u>centipoise<\/u><\/a>\u00a0&#8211; a specific unit of measurement, and at around 410F (210C) this forms the consistency of \u2018Pancake Syrup\u2019 which is sufficient and safe for low pressure application.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Adhesiveness<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Generally speaking, Polyamide materials are considered to be high-performance hot-melt. Polyamide has an adhesive quality that accompanies it and this is what helps to seal in components.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The Low Pressure Molding Application Process<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">If a PCB board or other circuitry is to be Low Pressure Molded, then after the PCB has been manufactured, it will then move on to the next phase which is Low Pressure Molding.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Low Pressure Mold starts out in small pellet form, these pellets are measured out into the correct quantity\/weight required and fed into a specialist LPM machine &#8211; which also houses the mold template to be filled. The finished PCB is placed into the machine &#8211; or a cold-mold set is applied as an initial barrier to any heat from the pressured injection. Then it\u2019s ready for applying the main thermoplastics layer. Once heated to 410F, the Polyamide is then injected &#8211; either manually or mechanically using low pressure methods, usually around 50 to 200 PSI.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The flow is maintained and regulated, it will surround components and even begin drying and sealing on contact. The amount injected is measured and directed exactly to fill all the necessary components and leave a finished surface. High-speed advances mean this process typically only takes a few seconds per application, with the completed injection, drying and finishing time extending up to about 1 minute. Resulting in viability for mass production.<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\">Injection To Combat shrinkage<\/span><\/strong>[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Once injected, the Polyamide will typically reduce, or shrink in size during the drying phase. In order to compensate for this, the unit is continuously injected in order to maintain pressure against the units and fill any void left by shrinkage. This process is continued until the Polyamide transforms from a liquid to a solid. i.e. heated to cooled. meanwhile, the cold-mold application will absorb any undue pressure and heat that may occur during the process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">This technique has been proven to protect fragile components while not rupturing electronics or solder joints and does not impede the performance of the unit.<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][vc_single_image image=&#8221;3393&#8243; img_size=&#8221;600X600&#8243; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221; image_hovers=&#8221;false&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\">Why We Use Low Pressure Molding<\/span><\/strong>[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Since the 1970s when low pressure molding was developed in Europe, the use has spread to most industrial and consumer areas. Initially developed for the automotive industry to replace heavier alternatives such as Potting process which was also more toxic and to provide an efficient, sealed and protective environment for components that otherwise would suffer from undue strain and breakage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Techniques have since improved still further, providing greater protection and being able to cover more complex systems. So Low Pressure Molding has extended to cover not only industrial and commercial uses but also to Military and Aerospace applications, where more extreme equipment and electronics require more robust solutions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Add to this that low pressure molding is a less toxic environmentally friendly solution and you can see why its use has extended to most areas of circuitry protection.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Here\u2019s a list of typical applications for Low Pressure Molding<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Military<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Aerospace<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Automotive<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Static Industrial Equipment<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Mobile Industrial Equipment<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Construction Equipment<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Consumer Electronics<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Motors and Control Boards<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Submersible Equipment<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Sensors<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Lighting Setups<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Mobile Electronics such as USB drives and Remote controls<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Almost all forms of manufactured wiring<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">In many applications the molding itself has developed to become an essential part of the unit itself, for example, the molding used in USB Pen drives and Remote Car Door Locks often form part of &#8211; or the complete outer casing of the product, or in some instances dictates the shape of the outer casing.<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h2><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\">The Benefits of Low Pressure Molding<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Lightweight Material<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">As opposed to heavier more cumbersome techniques, hot-melts provide a more weight efficient final product which is ideal for most applications<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Watertight Finish<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Units that could otherwise be prone to water damage can now be hermetically sealed from outside, allowing sometimes deepwater equipment to remain safe and fully functioning.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Multiple Surface Adhesion<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Low pressure molding, along with the cold-mold enables a multitude of different materials to be applied with adhesive in order to help stabilize and secure components in place.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Shock Resistant<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">PCBs and other components used in high impact environments can now be afforded greater protection from impact and other damage suffered whilst in use.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Chemical Resistant<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Components coming into contact with externally non-acidic applied chemicals can now be protected without harm occurring to internal circuitry<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Compact<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The use of low pressure seals provides internal protection, requiring less outer protective needs.
